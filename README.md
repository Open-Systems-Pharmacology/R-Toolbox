# R-Toolbox

## About the Toolbox
The R Toolbox is a collection of R functions which allows the processing of models developed in PK-Sim速 or MoBi速 from within R. A variety of functions is offered to manipulate models, to simulate models, and to handle simulation results. 
The functions are designed very similar to the functions that are provided with the [MoBi速 Toolbox for Matlab速](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Matlab-Toolbox).
Details are available in the build-in help of R upon loading the R package.

## Installing the R Toolbox
The R Toolbox is provided to the user as a zip file. This zip file can be found under **"C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Systems Pharmacology\MoBi Toolbox for R _X.Y_\MoBiToolboxForR__X.Y.Z_.zip"** . The standard package install via zip files is used. On Windows, **_install.packages_** can install a binary package from a local zip file by setting argument _repos_ to NULL.
Rgui.exe has a menu Packages with a GUI interface to **_install.packages_** that may be used.

## Getting Started
* Install nuget and add nuget.exe to your path
* Install ruby version 2.2 or higher
* clone the repository with recursive option 
```
git clone <url.git> --recursive
```
* restore nuget packages manually
```
nuget restore packages.config -PackagesDirectory packages
```
* create the package and setup
```
rake create_setup[7.1.0]
